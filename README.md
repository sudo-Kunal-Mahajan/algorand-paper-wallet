# Algorand's Paper Wallet Generator

The app allows you to generate a paper wallet containing your mnemonic as well as the public address that can you store in a secure place.

It creates a 2x2 matrix in the following manner:

| Algorand Logo | Mnemonic |
| -- | -- |
| QR Code |  Empty Message Area |

- After printing the paper wallet, you can fold it such that Algorand Logo is shown on one side and QR code on another. Mnemonic is folded behind the QR code which prevents it from being scanned.
- Laminate the print in the folded manner and store it in a secure place. Only when required, cut open the laminate and get access to the mnemonic.
- An empty area is provided to write any message that you want to store along with the mnemonic. This area is also folded behind the QR code.
